Real-Time Face Recognition System Algorithm

1. Import necessary libraries: opencv, pytorch, numpy, ultralytics
2. Import YOLO model for face detection
3. Check if we are able to run it on Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
4. Import Insightface model for creating face embeddings
5. add_person function for adding person and embedding to database
6. Turn on camera
7. Main Loop:
        Process frames and predict faces
        Plot bounding boxes
8. Close camera
