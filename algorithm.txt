Real-Time Face Recognition System Algorithm

1. Import necessary libraries: opencv, pytorch, numpy, ultralytics
2. Import YOLO model for face detection
3. Check if we are able to run it on Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
4. Import Insightface model for creating face embeddings
5. add_person function for adding person and embedding to database
6. recognize_face function
        This function runs YOLO face detection, finds the matching InsightFace
        bounding box, extracts the aligned embedding via ArcFace, and compares it
        with stored embeddings in the database. If similarity exceeds threshold, the
        function returns the matched name; otherwise it returns UNKNOWN.
6. Turn on camera
7. Main Loop:
        Process recognize_face and return output
        Plot bounding boxe
        Plot name and score
8. Close camera
