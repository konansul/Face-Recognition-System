Real-Time Face Recognition System Algorithm

1. Import necessary libraries: opencv, pytorch, numpy, ultralytics
2. Import YOLO model
3. Check if we are able to run it on Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
4. Turn on camera
5. Main Loop:
        Process frames and predict faces
        Plot bounding boxes
6. Close camera
